Remember, boys and girls need the same amount of check-ups.\r\n\r\nVisit the doctor or nurse at the local health centre with your baby at least once during week 1 and again when she is 6 weeks old. \r\n\r\nTake your baby to a doctor or nurse at the local health centre (puesto de salud o centro de salud) immediately if:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tHer belly is too cold or too hot\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShe develops yellow eyes, hands and feet within the first day of his life\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShe refuses to feed or sucks poorly\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShe will not stop crying or if his cry sounds unusual\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShe has a fit, is drowsy and not moving much, or has bluish skin or nails\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShe is wheezing, grunting, or breathing quickly \r\n\r\n\u2022\tShe is vomiting after every feed for more than a day, or has a swollen tummy\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe area around your baby's cord stump is red or smelly\r\n\r\nThese are signs that your baby is unwell, and needs treatment quickly.\r\n",
