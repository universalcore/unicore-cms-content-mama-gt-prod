  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIt is important to rest after pregnancy loss. Try not to do any hard work until the bleeding stops.\r\n\r\nYour body needs time to heal. You will bleed for a while. You may also have something that feels like period pain. Do not have sex until the bleeding has stopped, to protect your womb from germs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps ask your family for help. They could help you with household tasks or care for your other children, if you have them. \r\n\r\nYour breasts may leak and they could swell. This can be upsetting. You could wear a supportive cloth or bra. Put clean pieces of cloth in it to soak up leaks. Do not squeeze out the milk. The milk will go away slowly by itself over a few weeks.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tRight now, your body needs rest and care. Try to eat well, with lots of fruit, vegetables, eggs, tofu, soy beans, fish or meat. If you take iron and folic acid tablets, carry on. They will help too.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tFor now, use a contraceptive method. By waiting until your body has recovered before you try for another baby, you will be giving yourself the best chance for a healthy pregnancy in the future.\r\n\r\nWarning signs after pregnancy loss\r\n\r\nIf the pain gets worse or you soak a pad in an hour, see a doctor or nurse at the local health centre immediately. \r\n\r\nAlso see a doctor or nurse if you have:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSticky, smelly fluid coming from your vagina\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\tA fever\r\n\r\n\u2022\tFaintness\r\n\r\n\u2022\tA pain in your shoulders\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPainful, red areas on your breasts\r\n\r\n\u2022\tBleeding that will not stop",
