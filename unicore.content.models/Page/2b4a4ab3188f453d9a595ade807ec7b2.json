  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIt is common to get headaches during pregnancy, particularly in the first 3 months.\r\nHeadaches and migraines may be caused by pregnancy hormones. Feeling tired or stressed can tense your muscles and give you a headache. Missing meals and feeling hungry might bring on a headache. Or having more sleep than usual, or too little sleep. \r\n\r\nHere are some things you can do: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tMake sure you can take a break during the day and rest. Explain to your family that while your body is growing a baby, you need more rest. Sit or lie down somewhere quiet, and sleep if you need to.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tDip a cloth in warm, clean water and squeeze out to make a warm pad. Put it around your eyes and nose. Or you could try a cool cloth on your forehead or at the base of your neck.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAsk someone to massage your neck and shoulders.\r\n\r\nDanger signs? Headache, blurred vision and pain under your ribs can be signs of high blood pressure. Go to see a doctor or nurse at the local health centre as soon as you can if you feel like this.\r\n",
