  "content": "Five ways to stay healthy\r\n\r\n1.\tEat well. Try to eat some fruits and vegetables every day. Eat rice, coconut milk and eggs regularly. Black beans and corn are good. Add cashew nuts and peanuts to your food to make it even healthier. Fruits like mangoes, papayas and jackfruits are good. Get lots of them. Try to have 1 extra handful of food with every meal. Do not go without food for too long. Carry some food with you if you have to go somewhere. Drink plenty of clean, safe water and try INCAPARINA, it is cheap and healthy.\r\n\r\n2.\tGet check-ups while you are pregnant. Try to have 4 visits to your doctor or nurse at the local health centre (puesto de salud o centro de salud). Get your blood and urine tests and blood pressure checks done regularly. These tests help to find problems early. Then you can get treatment and keep yourself and your baby safe. \r\n\r\n3.\tGet tested for HIV if you are worried. If you are HIV+, there are medicines to help keep you well and prevent your baby from being born HIV+. If you find out you are not HIV+, you can make sure you stay that way.\r\n\r\n4.\tTake your pregnancy tablets. These tablets help your baby grow well. Ask your doctor or nurse at the local health centre (puesto de salud o centro de salud) if you can get them free. \r\n\r\n1.\tKeep clean. Wash your hands with soap before cooking and eating and after using the toilet. \r\n",
